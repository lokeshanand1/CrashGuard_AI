# CrashGuard AI
### Real-Time Intelligent Road Accident Detection and Emergency Response System

CrashGuard AI is an AI-powered road safety system designed to detect traffic accidents in real time using CCTV or live video feeds. The system utilizes deep learning and computer vision models to identify accidents and automatically trigger emergency alerts to nearby hospitals and traffic infrastructure.

The project integrates edge-based accident detection, temporal event verification, and vehicle network communication (VANET/V2X) to create a fast and reliable accident response system for smart cities.

## Project Overview

Road accidents often go unreported for several minutes, delaying emergency response and increasing fatalities. CrashGuard AI solves this problem by continuously monitoring traffic video feeds and automatically detecting accidents using a trained deep learning model.

Once an accident is detected, the system:
- Confirms the event using temporal motion analysis
- Captures and stores accident evidence
- Determines the nearest hospital
- Sends emergency alerts with accident location and image
- Broadcasts accident notifications through VANET-style messaging

This system can be deployed with smart-city CCTV infrastructure to improve road safety and emergency response times.

- Edge AI processing for low latency detection
- Temporal verification to reduce false positives
- Automatic accident image capture and processing
- Nearest hospital detection using location services
- Automated emergency alert messaging
- VANET / V2X style accident broadcast system
- Web interface using Flask for monitoring
- Compatible with CCTV and video feeds

## System Architecture

The system consists of multiple modules working together:
### 1. Detection Module
Uses a trained YOLO model to detect potential accident events in video frames.
### 2. Temporal Verification Module
Analyzes frame sequences to verify if the detected event is truly an accident.
### 3. Location Detection
Retrieves the accident location information.
### 4. Nearest Hospital Finder
Uses map APIs to identify the closest hospital to the accident site.
### 5. Alert Messaging System
Sends emergency messages containing accident details.
### 6. Image Upload Module
Uploads captured accident images and converts them into accessible URLs.
### 7. VANET Communication Layer
Broadcasts accident alerts using vehicle network communication concepts.
### 8. Web Interface
Provides a simple Flask web interface to run and monitor the system.
